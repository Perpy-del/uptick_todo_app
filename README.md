# Take-Home Project For Frontend Development Track 2024

### Project

Develop a task management application that allows users to create, update, and delete tasks. The application should provide a user-friendly
interface for managing tasks effectively.

### Requirements

- Implement functionality to add new tasks with a title, description, and due date.

- Enable users to mark tasks as complete or incomplete.

- Allow users to edit existing tasks and update their details.

- The application should fetch the data from a public API.

- Provide an option to delete tasks from the list.

### User Interface
-   Design a clean and intuitive user interface for the task management application.

-   Use appropriate layout techniques to organize tasks and provide clear navigation options.

-   Ensure ease of use and accessibility for users of all levels.

### Data Persistence:
-   Store task data locally using browser storage mechanisms like localStorage or IndexedDB.
-   Implement data retrieval and manipulation functions to interact with stored task data.

### Validation and Error Handling:
-   Validate user input to ensure data integrity and prevent errors.
-   Handle edge cases gracefully, such as empty inputs or invalid dates.

### Responsive Design:
-   Make the application responsive to different screen sizes and devices.
-   Ensure that the user interface adapts smoothly to mobile, tablet, and desktop environments.

### Interactivity:
-   Add interactive elements to enhance user experience, such as buttons, forms, and feedback messages.
-   Implement smooth transitions and animations to make the application more engaging.

### Version Control and Documentation:
-   Use Git for version control and maintain a well-structured repository.
-   Include clear and concise documentation explaining how to set up and run the application locally.
-   Document any design decisions or trade-offs made during development.

### Additional Guidelines:
-   You can choose to implement the application using vanilla JavaScript or any frontend framework of your choice (e.g., React, Angular,
Vue.js).
-   Focus on code quality, readability, and adherence to best practices.
-   Test the application thoroughly to identify and fix any bugs or issues.
